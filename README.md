# Exploring-Adventure-Works-Database-using-SQL

### Project Overview
In a bid to hone my SQL skills and addressing business challenges, I embarked on an exploration of the Adventure Works database. The AdventureWorks database, created by Microsoft revolves around a fictional company called Adventureworks Cycle, which represents a multinational manufacturing company on a large scale. 
The aim of this project is to discover valuable insights regarding sales patterns, factors influencing sales performance, and customer purchasing behavior across diverse regions. These insights will serve as a foundation for enhancing sales strategies and driving improvements in overall sales performance.

### Tools
- SQL- EDA
- Power BI- Data Visualization

### Analysis and Visualization
To answer the problem statements, a thorough analysis was conducted with SQL and the queries integrated into Power BI,for a more compelling representation of the answers.
